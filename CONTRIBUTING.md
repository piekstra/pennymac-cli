# Contributing to pennymac-cli

Thanks for your interest! Contributions — bug reports, fixes, new commands,
docs — are welcome under the project's dual [MIT](LICENSE-MIT) /
[Apache-2.0](LICENSE-APACHE) license: by opening a pull request you agree your
contribution is licensed under those same terms.

## Ground rules (this reads a real person's mortgage account)

- **Never commit secrets or personal data.** The password, session cookie, and
  device-trust cookies live only in the OS keychain. Nothing credential-like or
  personal belongs in the repo, tests, fixtures, or commit messages.
- **Fixtures are scrubbed captures.** Structure is preserved exactly; every
  name, address, balance, amount, ID, and token is replaced with an obvious
  dummy. See [`tests/fixtures/README.md`](tests/fixtures/README.md) — a test
  enforces it. Never commit a raw capture.
- **Read-only by default.** Every command observes. This CLI implements no
  mutating endpoint; the write catalog in `src/writes.rs`, the `api` POST
  guard, and the docs must stay in agreement.
- **Secrets never on argv or in logs.** Read them from the keychain or stdin.

## Dev loop

```console
$ make verify     # fmt-check + clippy -D warnings + tests + smoke — the CI gate
$ make test       # unit + integration (fully offline; no network, no creds)
$ make dev        # debug build, re-signed so keychain grants survive rebuilds
$ cargo run -- <command>
```

`make verify` is exactly what CI runs; a green local run predicts a green CI run.

## Pull requests

1. Branch from `main`; keep the change focused.
2. Add or update tests. Contract tests load fixtures from disk — extend
   `tests/fixtures/` (scrubbed!) rather than inlining JSON in test code.
3. Keep the human table and the `--json` DTO in sync. A breaking DTO change
   bumps its `schema` version suffix.
4. Update [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md) when you learn something new about the
   portal, and the README when you change the command surface.
5. Run `make verify` and include what you tested.

## A note on the portal

Pennymac publishes no customer API, so everything here is reverse-engineered and
can break when they ship a redesign. If a command starts returning empty
columns, check `docs/api.md` against a fresh capture (`pmac api <path>`) — a
renamed field is the usual culprit, and the contract tests in
`tests/fixture_shapes.rs` are where the fix gets pinned down.

Testing a change against the live portal can cost a one-time SMS code, and those
are rate-limited. The whole test suite is offline for exactly that reason;
please keep it that way.
